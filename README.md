Option Pricing Tool - Black-Scholes Model
Overview
Welcome to the Option Pricing Tool, an interactive application built using Python and Streamlit. This tool allows you to calculate and visualize the price of options based on the Black-Scholes model, one of the most widely used methods in financial markets for pricing European call and put options.

The project is designed with a user-friendly interface that provides a clear representation of the option's payoff as a function of the underlying asset's price. You can customize key variables such as:

Current price of the underlying asset (S)
Strike price (K)
Time to expiration (T)
Risk-free rate (r)
Volatility (Ïƒ)
Quantity of options


Goal
The goal of this project is to create a practical tool for anyone interested in understanding the core mechanics of option pricing and to provide an intuitive interface for quick and accurate calculations.
